               The TODO List for The Linux Audio Backstop

WebCatcher: convert the DayOfWeek labels in the traffic table to two-letter 
abbreviations and hard-align them within the overall field so it's easy to 
see at a glance what days are programmed.  
(Scott Spillers, 5/8/2000) -- IMPLEMENTED 5/11/2000


WebCatcher: The day of week labels on the change record change page sometime
appear above the checkbox rather than alongside.  Reformat.
(Scott Spillers, 5/8/2000) -- FIXED 5/11/2000

Labd/WebCatcher: Create an asplay logging scheme.  Log data should be
accessible in both a shell and web environment.
(Scott Spillers, 5/8/2000)

WebCatcher: The choices for the 'Channels' parameter on the record change 
page should be MONO or STEREO rather than 1 or 2.  1 or 2 is confusing.
(Scott Spillers, 5/8/2000) -- IMPLEMENTED 5/11/2000

Labd: Implement the closure command sets.

WebCatcher: Add the ability to audition tips and tails of the recorded audio
remotely.
