                 History file for the Linux Audio Backstop

9/24/2004 -- Release 2.1.0
Added the ability to control outboard switcher devices by means of UDP
packets.  See the lab.conf(5) manpage for details, particularly the
'SwitchType=' and 'SwitchDevice=' directives.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3/07/2004 -- Release 2.0.0
Major feature additions, including:
    Support for the line of GPIO cards manufactured by
    MeasurementComputing [http://www.measurementcomputing.com/].

    Timed Switch Event -- Run a switcher command without affecting any
    active Record or Playback events.

    Pulse Relay Event -- Schedule a relay closure.

    Relay Record/Playback -- Record and play back relay events in
    syncronization with audio.  See the labd(8) manpage and the 'Relay
    Map' link on the webcatcher interface for details.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2/12/2003 -- Release 1.2.0
Converted the package to use Autoconf and Automake.  Otherwise, not
much changed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6/19/2002 -- Release 1.1.3
Added a new line terminator code 'CR' that places a single ASCII carriage
return (0x0D) at the return of each switcher command.  Needed support the
Wegener Unity4000.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2/8/2002 -- Release 1.1.2
Fixed a bug that causing the build to fail on a Slackware 8.0 system, due to
a missing include for <time.h>.

Changed the default install locations for HTML pages and CGI scripts to
'/var/www/htdocs' and '/var/www/cgi-bin' (in accordance with the new
layout in Slackware 8.0). 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5/2/2001 -- Release 1.1.1
Fixed a bug that was causing a '/' to be prepended to the filename in each
traffic entry when modified using the WebCatcher when audioroot was specified 
without a trailing '/' in lab.conf(5).

Corrected some minor typos in the lab.conf(5) man page.

Fixed a bug that was causing labd to go catatonic upon reception of a SIGHUP
when running detached.

Fixed a bug in WebCatcher that was causing the deck status table to 
display incorrect feed sources and start and stop times.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5/22/2000 -- Release 1.1.0
Enhanced the AutoTrim feature so that the tail as well as the head of the
audio records are trimmed, using the same threshold value.

Updated 'lab.html'.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5/16/2000 -- Release 1.0.12
Added sort capabilities to the WebCatcher interface.  Traffic entries
will now sorted by time, with wildcard entries being placed first.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5/16/2000 -- Release 1.0.11
Fixed a bug that was allowing new traffic records to be created with zero
length.

Fixed a bug that was causing the webcatcher to fail to propogate configuration
values through error pages.

Fixed a bug in the webcatcher that was causing all new traffic events to be
configured to use deck zero regardless of the deck requested.

Fixed a bug in labd that was causing the scoreboard data to be reset upon
reception of a SIGHUP.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5/11/2000 -- Release 1.0.10
Corrected the CHANNELS section of the help file so that it now agrees with
'Mono/Stereo' labeling on the Webcatcher widget.

Changed the formatting of the DayOfWeek fields on the traffic records table
so that it's possible to see what days are selected without referring to
the column headers.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5/11/2000 -- Release 1.0.9
Cleaned up several formatting issues in the Webcatcher interface, resulting
in a cleaner, less confusing interface.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5/6/2000 -- Release 1.0.8
Added full, context sensitive help to the traffic record page.  Clicking the
a field name now brings up help on that field in a new browser window.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5/5/2000 -- Release 1.0.7
Removed the HELP button from the event records page in the webcatcher 
interface, which was causing all sorts of bizarre  behavour in the Netscape
forms interface.  I'm still not sure why.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5/5/2000 -- Release 1.0.6
The first real attempt at a release version for the WebCatcher.  Added an HTML
doc file detailing all the field meanings, and hacked the Makefile so the 
install rule handles the HTML/CGI stuff properly.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5/5/2000 -- Release 1.0.5
The first fully functional WebCatcher release.  Everything works!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5/3/2000 -- Release 1.0.4
Not a fully functional release -- interim only!

More Webcatcher stuff.  Traffic record changing now works.  Added a refresh
button to the base status page and removed the daemon control buttons.  Still
needed is implementation of the ADD and DELETE traffic record functions.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5/2/2000 -- Release 1.0.3
Not a fully functional release -- interim only!

Added a scoreboard file, where info on the current status of the 'labd' daemon
is written out.  Needed for the WebCatcher interface.

Began implementation of the Webcatcher interface.  Basic structure created,
process control, record change interface.  Still needs lots more work!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4/25/2000 -- Release 1.0.2
Mostly about signals.  Major rewrite of the signal handlers in 'labd', 
resulting in improved efficiency and fewer (hopefully no) bugs.

Fixed a race in 'labd's SIGHUP handler.

Fixed the bug that was causing recordings to die upon reception of a
SIGHUP by 'labd'.

Fixed the bug that was causing 'labd' to skip the next scheduled event after
reception of a SIGHUP.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4/25/2000 -- Release 1.0.1
Added the ability, using the NAME field in the 'lab.traffic' file, to specify
the source switcher channel on the same line as a timed record (TR) event.
The name supplied in the NAME field is matched against a table of name/command
pairs (defined in 'lab.conf') and the correponding switcher command sent out
the appropriate tty port.  This, in conjunction with the change to the 
DayOfWeek entry made in 1.0.0, should enable us to *greatly* reduce the size
and complexity of 'lab.traffic' for most situations.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4/20/2000 -- Release 1.0.0
A major rewrite of the traffic file code, mostly modularization to easily
allow for getting traffic data from a variety of sources in the future
(i.e. flat file, mSQL, etc.).  Also added the WriteTraffic() call to allow
already loaded traffic data to be written back to a flat file -- needed for
the WebCatcher interface.

Changed the meaning of the DayOfWeek entry in the traffic file.  Instead of
a one-to-one correspondence, where 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, etc, it is now a 
bitwise-ORed field, with the LSB representing Sunday and the MSB (2^6)
meaning Saturday.  This now allows us to represent an entire week's recording
schedule on just a single line of the traffic file.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2/8/2000  -- Release 0.6.0
Backported the lab components (as opposed to the labd ones) from 0.5.2 into
the special WRFD version, which became 0.6.0.  Labd in the WRFD version has a 
variable baud rate switcher interface that actually works with the Unity 4000!
Hopefully, this finally gets us back to a stable, unified source path.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2/8/2000  -- Release 0.5.2
Backported 'labd.c' from lab-0.3.2.  Quick fix for some serious flakiness,
needed to get WNIV and WRFD fixed!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1/26/2000 -- Release 0.5.1
Added the SkipWeekend function. Enabling this causes time elapsed over the
weekend to not be counted when calculating the shelf life for audio recorded 
on Fridays for playback on Saturday, Sunday or Monday.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
