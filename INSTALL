These are the installation instructions for the Linux Audio Backstop.
Please be sure to see the file README for general information before
proceeding!

IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE
The default installation of the Linux Audio Backstop is not secure!
Specifically, you need to be sure to properly define the 'Owner=' and
'Group=' directives for your system in the '/etc/lab.conf' file,
otherwise any user with access to the Web Catcher interface will be
able to schedule arbitrary shell commands on the system with root
permissions.  See the lab.conf(5) man page for details on setting
these directives.

PREREQUISITES
You will need the following installed and working on your system before
proceeding:

GPIO Driver
If you are using one of the cards from MeasurementComputing, you
will need to install the GPIO driver.  Available at:

     ftp://ftp.salemradiolabs.com/pub/srlabs/gpio/

RPMs for SuSE are also available at:

     ftp://ftp.salemradiolabs.com/pub/srlabs/gpio/suse


Apache Web Server
Needed for the WebCatcher CGI Interface.  The installation locations for
the CGI scripts and static HTML elements can be configured by means of
the following arguments to './configure':

--pkglib=PATH
Where 'PATH' is the directory to put the CGI scripts in.  Defaults to
'/srv/www/cgi-bin'

--datadir=PATH
Where 'PATH' is the directory to put the static HTML elements in.
Defaults to '/srv/www/htdocs'

It is *highly* recommended that the directory selected for the CGI
scripts be protected by some form of password protection, as anyone
accessing these scripts will have full control of the events schedule.
See the Apache documentation for details on how to do this.

INSTALLATION
Once the prerequisites are set up, installation is simply a matter of 
typing './configure', followed by 'make' and (as root) by 
'make install' in the top level directory.  

A configuration file, '/etc/lab.conf' needs to be created before
starting the labd(8) daemon.  The file 'lab.conf.example' in the top
of the source tree should provide some sane defaults.  All options for
this file are documented in the lab.conf(5) manpage.  Additionally,
the '/etc/lab.traffic' file should be created for scheduling events.
It is highly recommended that the WebCatcher CGI Interface be used to
program events.  On a default installation, this interface can be
accessed via any forms-capable browser at the following URL:

	 http://lab-hostname/cgi-bin/wcatch.cgi

where 'lab-hostname' is the hostname or IP address of the system
running the labd(8) daemon.

Good Luck!
